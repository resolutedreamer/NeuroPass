This is the first completed release of NeuroPass put together since the end of Fall Quarter 2013. NeuroPass is a password system that uses EEG waves collected from the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset, which is the full version of Emotiv's EPOC headset and allows the use of raw EEG data. The raw EEG data on several of the channels is used by our program in order to encode a password.
