filers is the code from 08:41 AM on 12/09/13 

filers works. it contains the functions:
main, loaddata, countlines, IIRSOS, filterdata,
dcoffsetbegone, findmean, findstd, calcthreshold
fpeaks,sort_and_combine,get_total_events,remove_excess_peaks
the struct: Events

SD ram set to 0x00f00000

It worked fine with a file of 2 minutes of data.

(2016-05-13) This code will (hopefully) be cleaned up at a later date.
