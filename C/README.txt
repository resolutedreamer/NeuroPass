filers_V3 is the code from 08:41 AM on 12/09/13 

filers_v3 works. it contains the functions:
main, loaddata, countlines, IIRSOS, filterdata,
dcoffsetbegone, findmean, findstd, calcthreshold
fpeaks,sort_and_combine,get_total_events,remove_excess_peaks
the struct: Events

SD ram set to 0x00f00000


It worked fine with a file of 2 minutes of data.

THIS IS THE CODE WE DEMO'D at 3:00 PMISH ON MONDAY OF FINALS WEEK TO BRIGGS

IT SORT OF FAILED ON THE TEST DATA ("ANTHONY")
DID NOT MATCH THE MATLAB EXACTLY.
