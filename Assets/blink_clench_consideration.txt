Consideration:

Fig1: Find all peaks. (required)
		ref=ch2
		thresholding based on ref
		
		dataset=ch1
		finds all peaks in ch1 (blinks and clenches) --> Fig2

Fig3: Find clenching peaks (bad but good results)
		ref=ch1
		thresholding based on ref
		
		dataset=ch1
		finds all peaks in ch1 (clenches) --> Fig4
		
Fig5: Find clenching peaks (good but worse results)
		ref=ch2
		thresholding based on ref
		
		dataset=ch1
		finds all peaks in ch2 (clenches) --> Fig6
